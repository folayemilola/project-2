    <h2>A little About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, My name is Oluwadamilola Folayemi, but you can call me Lola.
      Currently, I'm a second-year student pursuing a major in Information
      Technology and Management (ITM) at the Illinois Institute of Technology
      (IIT). Passionate about technology's transformative power, I'm eager to
      delve deeper into areas such as cybersecurity, data analytics, and
      software development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond academics, I value balance in life. During my leisure time, you'll
      often find me immersing myself in the vibrant energy of social gatherings
      with friends, cherishing every moment and fostering connections.
      Additionally, I indulge in the realm of entertainment, finding solace in
      binge-watching TV shows and recently discovering a newfound fascination
      for Anime, drawn to its captivating storytelling and diverse artistic
      styles. Through this eclectic mix of interests, I strive to embrace life's
      adventures with open arms, continuously seeking inspiration and growth in
      every experience.
